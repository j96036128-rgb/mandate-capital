                            submission. Opportunities matching stated parameters may be presented.

                    The engagement deposit is consideration for mandate review and sourcing effort.
                    It does not relate to deal delivery, transaction completion, or investment outcome.
                </p>

                    The deposit is not a success fee, advisory fee, or brokerage fee.

                        Typically 3–5 business days from submission with completed payment.
                        Complex or unusual mandates may require additional time.

                        Your engagement deposit is refunded in full within 10 business days.
                        Decline reflects our current sourcing capabilities, not mandate quality.

                        Yes. Each mandate requires a separate submission and engagement deposit.
