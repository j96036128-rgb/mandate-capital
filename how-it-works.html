                <h3 class="mt-3">Deposit Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit relates to mandate review and engagement initiation.
                    It does not relate to deal delivery, transaction completion, or investment outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The deposit does not constitute a success fee, advisory fee, or brokerage commission.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mt-3">Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Refunds apply only to accepted mandates. The 30-day window begins from the
                    date of written acceptance.

                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Typically 3–5 business days from submission with completed payment.
                        Complex or unusual mandates may require additional time.

                        Your engagement deposit is refunded in full within 10 business days.
                        Decline reflects our current sourcing capabilities, not mandate quality.
