                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Mandate Capital website
                    and services ("Services"). By submitting a mandate or using our Services, you agree
                    to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mandate Capital is a trading name. References to "we", "us", or "our" refer to

                <h2>2. Nature of Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Mandate Capital provides mandate intake and opportunity sourcing services.
                    We collect capital mandate specifications, review submissions, and source
                    opportunities for accepted mandates.
                </p>
                <h3>2.1 What We Are Not</h3>

                    <li>We are not a broker, dealer, or intermediary</li>
                    <li>We are not an investment adviser and do not provide investment advice</li>
                    <li>We are not a marketplace, platform, or exchange</li>
                    <li>We do not hold, manage, or have custody of client funds or assets</li>
                    <li>We do not execute transactions on behalf of clients</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2.2 No Investment Advice</h3>
                <p>
                    Nothing in our Services constitutes investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.
                    Any opportunities presented are for informational purposes only. You are solely
                    responsible for evaluating opportunities and making investment decisions.

                </p>

                <h2>3. Mandate Submission</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Eligibility</h3>
                <p>
                    By submitting a mandate, you represent and warrant that:
                </p>
                <ul>

                <h3>3.2 No Guarantee of Acceptance</h3>
                <p>
                    Submission of a mandate does not guarantee acceptance. We review all submissions
                    and accept or decline mandates at our sole discretion. We are not obligated to
                    provide reasons for declining a mandate.
                </p>
                <h3>3.3 Accuracy of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for ensuring all information provided is accurate, complete,
                    and current. We may request verification or additional information at any time.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Engagement Deposit</h2>
                <h3>4.1 When Deposit is Requested</h3>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit is requested only after written acceptance of a mandate.
                    No deposit is required at time of submission. Submission constitutes an expression
                    of interest only and does not create any financial obligation.
                </p>
                <h3>4.2 Amount and Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit is £500 per accepted mandate. The deposit relates to
                    mandate review and engagement initiation. It does not relate to deal delivery,
                    transaction completion, or investment outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit does not constitute a success fee, advisory fee, or
                    brokerage commission. Mandate Capital does not receive compensation contingent
                    on transaction completion.
                </p>
                <h3>4.3 Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    Refunds apply only to accepted mandates where the engagement deposit has been paid.
                    The 30-day refund window begins from the date of written acceptance.
                </p>
                <p>A refund may be issued if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mandate Capital withdraws acceptance within 30 days of the acceptance date</li>
                    <li>The capital provider requests withdrawal within 30 days of the acceptance date,
                        provided no opportunity has been presented</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No refund applies where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mandate scope is materially changed by the capital provider after acceptance</li>
                    <li>The mandate has progressed beyond initial sourcing (e.g., opportunity presented,
                        introduction made, or documentation exchanged)</li>
                    <li>The capital provider declines one or more opportunities substantively aligned
                        with the accepted mandate parameters</li>
                    <li>The 30-day period from acceptance has elapsed</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4.4 Determination of Alignment</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether an opportunity is substantively aligned with mandate parameters is
                    determined by Mandate Capital based on the accepted mandate specifications.
                    This determination is made in good faith and is not subject to dispute.
                </p>
                <h3>4.5 No Obligation to Source</h3>
                <p>
                    Payment of the engagement deposit does not obligate Mandate Capital to source,
                    present, or deliver any opportunity. No outcome is guaranteed. Mandate Capital
                    makes no representation regarding the availability, suitability, or quality of
                    opportunities.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Sourcing Process</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Scope of Sourcing</h3>
                <p>
                    For accepted mandates, we source and present opportunities matching your parameters.
                    We do not guarantee that opportunities will be available, suitable, or successful.
                </p>
                <h3>5.2 No Obligation to Proceed</h3>
                <p>
                    You are under no obligation to proceed with any opportunity presented.
                    All investment decisions remain solely with you.
                </p>
                <h3>5.3 Direct Dealings</h3>
                <p>
                    Any transaction arising from a presented opportunity is conducted directly between
                    you and the relevant counterparty. We are not a party to such transactions.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Fees</h2>
                <h3>6.1 Engagement Deposit</h3>
                <p>
                    The £500 engagement deposit is requested only upon written acceptance of a mandate.
                    No fee is charged at submission.
                </p>
                <h3>6.2 Additional Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    Any additional fees will only apply if explicitly agreed in writing. No success fees,
                    transaction fees, or other charges apply unless specifically documented and agreed
                    prior to any transaction.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>
                    We treat mandate information as confidential. However, we may share relevant
                    mandate details with potential opportunity providers as necessary to fulfil
                    sourcing obligations. By submitting a mandate, you consent to such disclosure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not publicly disclose mandate details or client identities without consent.
                </p>
