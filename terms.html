                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Axis Allocation website
                    and services ("Services"). By submitting a mandate or using our Services, you agree
                    to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use our Services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Axis Allocation is a trading name. References to "we", "us", or "our" refer to
                    Axis Allocation and its operators.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Nature of Services</h2>
                <p>
                    Axis Allocation provides mandate intake and opportunity sourcing services.
                    We collect capital mandate specifications, review submissions, and source
                    opportunities for accepted mandates.
                </p>
                <h3>2.1 What We Are Not</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are not a broker, dealer, or intermediary</li>
                    <li>We are not an investment adviser and do not provide investment advice</li>
                    <li>We are not a marketplace, platform, or exchange</li>
                    <li>We do not hold, manage, or have custody of client funds or assets</li>
                    <li>We do not execute transactions on behalf of clients</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2.2 No Investment Advice</h3>
                <p>
                    Nothing in our Services constitutes investment, financial, legal, or tax advice.
                    Any opportunities presented are for informational purposes only. You are solely
                    responsible for evaluating opportunities and making investment decisions.
                    We strongly recommend consulting qualified professional advisers.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Mandate Submission</h2>
                <h3>3.1 Eligibility</h3>
                <p>
                    By submitting a mandate, you represent and warrant that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You are at least 18 years of age</li>
                    <li>You have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements</li>
                    <li>If submitting on behalf of an entity, you are authorised to do so</li>
                    <li>The information you provide is accurate and complete</li>
                    <li>You meet any applicable investor qualification requirements in your jurisdiction</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>3.2 No Guarantee of Acceptance</h3>
                <p>
                    Submission of a mandate does not guarantee acceptance. We review all submissions
                    and accept or decline mandates at our sole discretion. We are not obligated to
                    provide reasons for declining a mandate.
                </p>
                <h3>3.3 Accuracy of Information</h3>
                <p>
                    You are responsible for ensuring all information provided is accurate, complete,
                    and current. We may request verification or additional information at any time.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Engagement Deposit</h2>
                <h3>4.1 Payment at Submission</h3>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit of £500 is required at the time of mandate submission.
                    Payment does not constitute acceptance of the mandate. Acceptance is discretionary
                    and issued separately in writing following review.
                </p>
                <h3>4.2 Purpose of Deposit</h3>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit is consideration for mandate review and sourcing effort.
                    It does not relate to deal delivery, transaction completion, or investment outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The engagement deposit is not a success fee, advisory fee, or brokerage fee.
                    Axis Allocation does not receive compensation contingent on transaction completion.
                </p>
                <h3>4.3 Refund Policy</h3>
                <p>
                    The 30-day period referenced below begins from the date of mandate submission.
                </p>
                <p>A full refund is issued if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Axis Allocation declines the mandate</li>
                    <li>The mandate is accepted but no aligned opportunity is presented within
                        30 days of submission</li>
                </ul>
                <p>No refund applies where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An aligned opportunity is presented within 30 days of submission and
                        declined by the capital provider</li>
                    <li>The mandate scope is materially changed by the capital provider after submission</li>
                    <li>The 30-day period from submission has elapsed</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>4.4 Determination of Alignment</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether an opportunity is substantively aligned with mandate parameters is
                    determined by Axis Allocation based on the submitted mandate specifications.
                    This determination is made in good faith and is final.
                </p>
                <h3>4.5 No Obligation to Source</h3>
                <p>
                    Payment of the engagement deposit does not obligate Axis Allocation to source,
                    present, or deliver any opportunity. No outcome is guaranteed. Axis Allocation
                    makes no representation regarding the availability, suitability, or quality of
                    opportunities.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Sourcing Process</h2>
                <h3>5.1 Scope of Sourcing</h3>
                <p>
                    For accepted mandates, we source and present opportunities matching your parameters.
                    We do not guarantee that opportunities will be available, suitable, or successful.
                </p>
                <h3>5.2 No Obligation to Proceed</h3>
                <p>
                    You are under no obligation to proceed with any opportunity presented.
                    All investment decisions remain solely with you.
                </p>
                <h3>5.3 Direct Dealings</h3>
                <p>
                    Any transaction arising from a presented opportunity is conducted directly between
                    you and the relevant counterparty. We are not a party to such transactions.
                </p>

                <h2>6. Fees</h2>
                <h3>6.1 Engagement Deposit</h3>
                <p>
                    The £500 engagement deposit is required at time of mandate submission.
                    See Section 4 for deposit terms and refund policy.
                </p>
                <h3>6.2 Additional Fees</h3>
                <p>
                    Any additional fees will only apply if explicitly agreed in writing. No success fees,
                    transaction fees, or other charges apply unless specifically documented and agreed
                    prior to any transaction.
                </p>

                <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>
                    We treat mandate information as confidential. However, we may share relevant
                    mandate details with potential opportunity providers as necessary to fulfil
                    sourcing obligations. By submitting a mandate, you consent to such disclosure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not publicly disclose mandate details or client identities without consent.
                </p>
